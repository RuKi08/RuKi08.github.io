You've seen them everywhere: on posters, in restaurants, on product packaging, and in marketing materials. But what exactly is a QR code, and how does it work?

### What Does "QR" Stand For?

QR stands for **Quick Response**. As the name suggests, QR codes are designed to be read quickly by a scanning device, like your smartphone's camera.

### How It Works

A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode. Unlike a traditional barcode that stores information horizontally, a QR code stores information in both horizontal and vertical patterns of black and white squares. This allows it to hold significantly more data.

When you scan a QR code with your phone, the camera and a QR reader app (often built into the camera app itself) interpret these patterns. The patterns are decoded into a string of text, a URL, contact information, or other data, which then prompts an action on your device, such as:

- Opening a website
- Connecting to a Wi-Fi network
- Showing text
- Displaying a map location
- Creating a pre-addressed email or SMS
