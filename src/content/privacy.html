            <p><strong>Last updated: November 2, 2025</strong></p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We collect and process information in the following ways, depending on the services you use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Client-Side Tools:</strong> A majority of our tools operate entirely within your web browser (\"client-side\"). For these tools, any data you input is processed on your own device and is <strong>never sent to, stored on, or seen by our servers</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Server-Side Tools:</strong> For certain tools that require data to be saved for later retrieval, we may store the information you voluntarily provide on third-party cloud infrastructure (such as Google Firebase). This is only done to provide the core functionality of the tool.</li>
                <li><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> For some games, we may store data such as your high score directly on your device using your browser's `localStorage` feature. This data is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We may use third-party services like Google Analytics to collect anonymous data about how you use our website (e.g., pages visited, time spent). This data helps us understand user behavior and improve the service.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
            <p>We use the information we collect solely to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our services.</li>
                <li>Understand and analyze how you use our services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p>Data for our server-side tools is stored using third-party cloud services like Google Firebase. We rely on their robust security measures to protect this data. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security as no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

            <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>Our service may contain links to other sites and uses third-party services (like Google Firebase for data storage and potentially Google Analytics for usage analysis). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other services and encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>

            <h3>5. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
